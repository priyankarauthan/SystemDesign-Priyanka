‚úÖ Step-by-Step OAuth 2.0 Login with Google
üîß 0. Pre-Setup (One-Time by Quora Developer)
Before any user login happens, Quora registers their app with Google:

Quora creates an OAuth Client ID and Client Secret in the Google Cloud Console.

During this setup, Quora specifies:

App name, logo, privacy policy

Redirect URIs, e.g. https://quora.com/oauth/callback

Google stores all of this and issues:

client_id

client_secret

üßë‚Äçüíª 1. User Clicks "Login with Google" on Quora
You go to Quora, click:
üëâ "Continue with Google"

Your browser is redirected to Google‚Äôs OAuth 2.0 authorization endpoint:

h
Copy
Edit
GET https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?
  client_id=QUORA_CLIENT_ID
  &redirect_uri=https://quora.com/oauth/callback
  &response_type=code
  &scope=email%20profile
  &state=xyz123
üîê 2. Google Shows Login Screen (if not already logged in)
You see Google‚Äôs login page (hosted on google.com) if you're not already logged in.

You enter your Google username and password.

This information never goes to Quora ‚Äî only to Google.

üßæ 3. Google Verifies and Authenticates
If your credentials are correct:

Google authenticates you.

Proceeds to ask for consent.

üîí 4. Consent Screen (Authorization)
If it's your first time logging in to Quora with Google:

Google shows a Consent Screen with:

App name (Quora)

Scopes requested (e.g., profile, email)

You click Allow to proceed.

üì¶ 5. Google Redirects Back to Quora with Authorization Code
After you allow, Google redirects your browser to the redirect URI Quora registered:

perl
Copy
Edit
https://quora.com/oauth/callback?code=abc123&state=xyz123
The code parameter is a temporary auth code

The state parameter is a CSRF protection measure (should match what Quora originally sent)

üîÅ 6. Quora Exchanges Code for Tokens (Server-to-Server)
Now, Quora‚Äôs backend server makes a secure POST request to Google‚Äôs token endpoint:

http
Copy
Edit
POST https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

client_id=QUORA_CLIENT_ID
&client_secret=QUORA_CLIENT_SECRET
&code=abc123
&redirect_uri=https://quora.com/oauth/callback
&grant_type=authorization_code
üì• 7. Google Responds with Tokens
Google responds with:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "access_token": "ya29.a0AfH6SMABC123...",
  "expires_in": 3599,
  "refresh_token": "1//0fghijklmNOPQ...",
  "scope": "email profile",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "id_token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsIn..."
}
Breakdown:
access_token: Short-lived token to access user info

id_token: JWT that identifies the user (optional in some flows)

refresh_token: Can be used to get new access tokens later (long-lived)

expires_in: Time in seconds (e.g., 3600s = 1 hour)

üì§ 8. Quora Uses Access Token to Get Your Profile
Quora now uses the access_token to call Google‚Äôs UserInfo API:

http
Copy
Edit
GET https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/userinfo
Authorization: Bearer ya29.a0AfH6SMABC123...
Google responds with your basic profile info:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "Priyanka Rauthan",
  "email": "priyanka@gmail.com",
  "picture": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/..."
}
üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 9. Quora Logs You In
If this is your first time: Quora creates a new account with your Google info.

If you already have an account: Quora logs you in.

Your session is now active üéâ

üîÑ 10. (Optional) Later When Access Token Expires
When the access token expires (usually in 1 hour):

Quora sends the refresh_token to Google to get a new access token in the background ‚Äî without user involvement.

h
Copy
Edit
POST https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token

client_id=...
&client_secret=...
&refresh_token=1//0fghijklmNOPQ...
&grant_type=refresh_token




















# High-Level Architecture for a Payment Gateway

## 1. Overview

A Payment Gateway is a financial service that facilitates online transactions by securely transferring payment information between merchants, customers, banks, and payment processors. It ensures encryption, fraud detection, and regulatory compliance.

## 2. Key Features

Multi-Party Payment Processing (Customer, Merchant, Issuing Bank, Acquiring Bank, Payment Processor)

Security & Encryption (PCI-DSS Compliance, TLS, Tokenization)

Fraud Detection & Risk Management (AI-based anomaly detection, rule-based checks)

Multi-Currency & Cross-Border Transactions

Settlement & Reconciliation

Webhook Notifications & Callback Handling

Dispute & Chargeback Management

API Integrations for Merchants & Partners

## 3. High-Level Architecture

### 3.1 Client Side (Frontend & Merchant Integration)

Web, Mobile Apps, POS terminals integrate with Payment Gateway via APIs

Payment SDKs for different platforms (Android, iOS, Web)

User authentication via OAuth2 / OpenID Connect (OIDC)

### 3.2 Payment Gateway Backend Services

Transaction Processing Service

Handles user requests, initiates payments

Communicates with acquiring bank/payment processors

Ensures transactional integrity

Payment Orchestration Layer

Routes transactions based on cost, location, risk, and failure rate

Load-balancing across multiple acquiring banks/processors

Fraud Detection & Risk Engine

Uses ML-based fraud detection

Rule-based checks (velocity checks, blacklists, geo-blocking)

Tokenization Service

Stores sensitive card details securely using PCI DSS standards

Generates a token for merchants instead of raw card details

Notification & Webhook Service

Sends real-time transaction status updates to merchants

Supports webhooks, email, SMS notifications

Settlement & Reconciliation Service

Ensures funds are correctly settled between banks & merchants

Generates reports for financial auditing

Chargeback & Dispute Management

Allows merchants to manage disputed transactions

Works with banks for resolution

## 4. Infrastructure & Deployment

### 4.1 API Gateway & Load Balancer
Manages API rate limits, request authentication, and routing

Load balances traffic to backend services

### 4.2 Database Layer

Relational DB (PostgreSQL/MySQL) for transactions & settlements

NoSQL DB (MongoDB, Redis) for session management & caching

Data Lake (HDFS/S3) for storing historical transaction data

### 4.3 Security & Compliance

Encryption (AES-256, TLS 1.3) for secure data transmission

Tokenization & Vault Storage for sensitive card data

PCI-DSS, GDPR, ISO 27001 compliance

### 4.4 Event-Driven Architecture

Kafka for real-time event streaming (transaction events, notifications)

Elasticsearch + Kibana for log analysis and monitoring

### 4.5 Scalability & Reliability

Microservices-based architecture for scalability

Kubernetes (K8s) + Docker for containerized deployment

Auto-scaling based on traffic patterns

## 5. Workflow: Payment Processing Flow

Customer initiates a payment ‚Üí Enters card details, selects UPI, or uses saved cards

Merchant Server calls Payment Gateway API ‚Üí Sends encrypted transaction details

Payment Gateway validates & tokenizes card details ‚Üí Checks for fraud & risk

Transaction sent to acquiring bank/payment processor ‚Üí Bank verifies funds

Bank sends response (Success/Failure) ‚Üí Payment Gateway notifies Merchant

Merchant fulfills order if successful ‚Üí Updates customer via webhook

## 6. Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js, Angular, iOS, Android SDK

Backend: Java (Spring Boot) / Node.js (Express)

Database: PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB

Messaging & Event Streaming: Kafka, RabbitMQ

Security: OAuth2, JWT, PCI-DSS Compliance

Cloud & DevOps: AWS/GCP/Azure, Kubernetes, Docker
