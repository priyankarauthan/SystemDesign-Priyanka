# High-Level Architecture for a Payment Gateway

## 1. Overview

A Payment Gateway is a financial service that facilitates online transactions by securely transferring payment information between merchants, customers, banks, and payment processors. It ensures encryption, fraud detection, and regulatory compliance.

## 2. Key Features

Multi-Party Payment Processing (Customer, Merchant, Issuing Bank, Acquiring Bank, Payment Processor)

Security & Encryption (PCI-DSS Compliance, TLS, Tokenization)

Fraud Detection & Risk Management (AI-based anomaly detection, rule-based checks)

Multi-Currency & Cross-Border Transactions

Settlement & Reconciliation

Webhook Notifications & Callback Handling

Dispute & Chargeback Management

API Integrations for Merchants & Partners

## 3. High-Level Architecture

# 3.1 Client Side (Frontend & Merchant Integration)

Web, Mobile Apps, POS terminals integrate with Payment Gateway via APIs

Payment SDKs for different platforms (Android, iOS, Web)

User authentication via OAuth2 / OpenID Connect (OIDC)

# 3.2 Payment Gateway Backend Services

Transaction Processing Service

Handles user requests, initiates payments

Communicates with acquiring bank/payment processors

Ensures transactional integrity

Payment Orchestration Layer

Routes transactions based on cost, location, risk, and failure rate

Load-balancing across multiple acquiring banks/processors

Fraud Detection & Risk Engine

Uses ML-based fraud detection

Rule-based checks (velocity checks, blacklists, geo-blocking)

Tokenization Service

Stores sensitive card details securely using PCI DSS standards

Generates a token for merchants instead of raw card details

Notification & Webhook Service

Sends real-time transaction status updates to merchants

Supports webhooks, email, SMS notifications

Settlement & Reconciliation Service

Ensures funds are correctly settled between banks & merchants

Generates reports for financial auditing

Chargeback & Dispute Management

Allows merchants to manage disputed transactions

Works with banks for resolution

## 4. Infrastructure & Deployment

### 4.1 API Gateway & Load Balancer
Manages API rate limits, request authentication, and routing

Load balances traffic to backend services

### 4.2 Database Layer

Relational DB (PostgreSQL/MySQL) for transactions & settlements

NoSQL DB (MongoDB, Redis) for session management & caching

Data Lake (HDFS/S3) for storing historical transaction data

### 4.3 Security & Compliance

Encryption (AES-256, TLS 1.3) for secure data transmission

Tokenization & Vault Storage for sensitive card data

PCI-DSS, GDPR, ISO 27001 compliance

### 4.4 Event-Driven Architecture

Kafka for real-time event streaming (transaction events, notifications)

Elasticsearch + Kibana for log analysis and monitoring

### 4.5 Scalability & Reliability

Microservices-based architecture for scalability

Kubernetes (K8s) + Docker for containerized deployment

Auto-scaling based on traffic patterns

## 5. Workflow: Payment Processing Flow

Customer initiates a payment → Enters card details, selects UPI, or uses saved cards

Merchant Server calls Payment Gateway API → Sends encrypted transaction details

Payment Gateway validates & tokenizes card details → Checks for fraud & risk

Transaction sent to acquiring bank/payment processor → Bank verifies funds

Bank sends response (Success/Failure) → Payment Gateway notifies Merchant

Merchant fulfills order if successful → Updates customer via webhook

## 6. Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js, Angular, iOS, Android SDK

Backend: Java (Spring Boot) / Node.js (Express)

Database: PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB

Messaging & Event Streaming: Kafka, RabbitMQ

Security: OAuth2, JWT, PCI-DSS Compliance

Cloud & DevOps: AWS/GCP/Azure, Kubernetes, Docker
